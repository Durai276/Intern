This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models including multiple linear regression, k-NN classifier, sentiment analysis.

Multiple Linear Regression: This implementation uses the statsmodels library to perform a multiple linear regression analysis on a dataset of predicting the price of cars based on certain conditions like horsepower, engine, brand_value.

k-NN Classifier: This script implements a k-nearest neighbors classifier using the scikit-learn library, applied to the digits dataset for digit classification.

Sentiment Analysis: This code processes text data to determine the sentiment expressed in it, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. It helps understand the emotional opinions and attitudes in various texts.

This YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting cars using symbols is a real-time object detection algorithm that processes images in a single pass, identifying and localizing car symbols efficiently with high accuracy. It divides images into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images.
