This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models including multiple linear regression, k-NN classifier, sentiment analysis.

Multiple Linear Regression: This implementation uses the statsmodels library to perform a multiple linear regression analysis on a dataset of predicting the price of cars based on certain conditions like horsepower, engine, brand_value.

k-NN Classifier: This script implements a k-nearest neighbors classifier using the scikit-learn library, applied to the digits dataset for digit classification.
